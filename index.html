    <p>
        My name is Javier Mariscal and I am currently learning to be a full stack developer.
        I am currently attending the UCF bootcamp and learning lots of skills in order to
        work at a fullstack development job. I have lots of potential since I am only 20 and 
        open to criticism since I always feel I have something to learn. I have worked in multiple
        group projects while being in a leadership position or just listening to what my group
        leader wants to do. All in all, I am a hard worker who is still willing to learn to 
        improve myself.
